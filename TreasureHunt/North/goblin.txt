What the heck is that???  Let's get out of here. Go South now! The south folder is back in our previous directory. Key in the following to go back one directory:

cd ..

Use your cd command to open the South folder. Then use the commands you know to open the file that exists there. 
 
*Note that you will have to figure out what that file is named using ls and open the file using the more command.
