Great clue following!  You now see that by typing in the more command you can display the contents of the file in the Terminal Shell.

Now for a new command.  Type ls into the command prompt.  

This will list all the files and folders available.  You should see start.txt and next.txt.  There is one more text file in this directory.  See if you can open the last text file just using ls and more commands.  

*Note that the more command will not work on directories (folders) so avoid the lines that do not have a .txt file extension.
